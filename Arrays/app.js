//There are few ways we can declare array

//1.
const arr1=[1,2,3,4,5,6];
console.log(arr1);

//2.
//Here we can either write new or not it doesnt matter even if you try out Array() it will work!
const arr2=Array(5);//first parameter state length and if you specify more then 1 number it will count as [1,2]
console.log(arr2);

//3.
const arr3=Array.of(1,2,34,4);//this is another method we can use to declare an array!
console.log(arr3);
